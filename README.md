# Fuzzy-Logic-Approach-for-Diagnosis-of-Diabetes
Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic disease in which the required amount of insulin is not produced
by the body or insulin is not properly used by the body, resulting in excessively high blood sugar
(glucose) levels. If diabetes is detected in its initial phase, then the disease can be controlled. On
the other hand, if diabetes is left undetected or untreated, it can cause serious harm to the body and
make it difficult to treat.
Diabetes is currently an incurable disease, and its treatment efficiency is primarily dependent on
accurate diagnosis and timely treatment. Therefore, we need a method to control and provide early
diagnostic information about DM. In order to detect diabetes, a wide variety of technologies and
algorithms have been employed like machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), data
mining, neural networks (NN), etc. But it is crucial to employ technologies that are interpretable
and understandable to humans. Fuzzy logic was developed to address these issues. It can be used
to deal with uncertainty of medical reasoning. In this project, a fuzzy approach was used to diagnose 
the severity of diabetes in patients.
